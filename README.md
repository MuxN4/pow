# Proof of Work Blockchain Demonstration

This project implements a simple Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain mechanism in Go, demonstrating the core principles of blockchain mining and block validation.

## Features

- Simple blockchain implementation
- Proof of Work consensus mechanism
- Configurable mining difficulty
- Block hashing and validation
- Dynamic nonce generation

## Requirements

- Go 1.23.4+
- github.com/fatih/color (for colored output)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `go mod tidy` to install dependencies
3. Run `go run main.go` to start the blockchain simulation

## Future Enhancements

- Difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Advanced performance metrics
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Maybe persistent storage

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Proof of Work mechanism
- Learn blockchain fundamentals
- Explore consensus algorithms
